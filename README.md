# Mobile-Application-for-Earthquake-Warning-Using-Earthquake-Monitoring-Virtual-Networks

This project presents a Mobile Application for Earthquake Warning Using
Earthquake Monitoring Virtual Networks. At present, an earthquake is an important
natural disaster. because if we can’t recognize that there is an earthquake and unable
to make a timely defense plan May cause damage and cause a lot of loss. That we
can quickly know that there is an earthquake, therefore it is important to reduce
various losses and can also plan a defense quickly The Mobile Application for
Earthquake Warning Using Earthquake Monitoring Virtual Networks will use server
information used as earthquake data and used as information in earthquake alerts on
mobile applications for earthquake alerts to ensure that the information is correct and
allows users to quickly plan their defenses
